Welcome to the Course Registration System.

In this, you will be able to create courses, course offerings, institutions, and teachers/students.

Courses have department names, code numbers, class names, and number of credits.

Course Offerings have an instance of a course, a section number, instructor, year, quarter, and students and enrolled. In this, one will be able to register new students for the course, view the current list of students, and submit/get grades for a given student.

Within Institutions, you can enroll students, hire instructors, add courses, view enrolled students, and many more features! 

Within teachers, you can view their list of courses taught and their personal information.

In students, you can view the student's number of credits, GPA, and current list of classes.
